<p id="geniusjoni"> Joni Mitchell is often described as the best singer-songwriter of her generation. She was born as Roberta Joan Anderson on November 7, 1943, in the small town of Fort Macleod, Canada. She recorded her first album in 1968, and the following year she released "Clouds", which earned her, her first Grammy Award. Over the course of her life, Joni has won a total of 8 Grammy Awards, while also becoming one of the most influential artists of the 70's. Her songs are caracterized by their vivid lyrical imagery and her use of details. In 1970, "Big Yellow Taxi" became her first true hit, but her Magnun Opus is the album "Blue" released in 1971. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/07/24/538307314/turning-the-tables-150-greatest-albums-made-by-women-page-15"> NPR's </a> considers it the "Greatest Album Made by Women" saying that <em> "After nearly fifty years, Blue remains the clearest and most animated musical map to the new world that women traced, sometimes invisibly, within their daily lives in the aftermath of the utopian, dream-crushing 1960s"</em>.
